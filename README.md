# Project Title

## Overview

This project is a C# application that connects to a SQL database. Below are the steps to set up the database, configure the connection, and run the application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- [ ] **.NET SDK**: You need to have .NET SDK installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
- [ ] **SQL Server**: A local or remote instance of SQL Server to host your database.
- [ ] **SQL Management Tool**: SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or any other SQL client to execute the provided SQL script.
  
## Setting Up the Database

1. Open your SQL management tool (e.g., SSMS).
2. Open the `Sql.txt` file provided in the project.
3. Run the SQL commands in `Sql.txt` to create the required database and tables.
   - This script will create the database schema and any initial data required to run the application.
4. Verify the database has been created by refreshing your database list in the SQL management tool.

## Configuring the Connection String

1. Open the project in your favorite IDE (e.g., Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code).
2. Navigate to the `appsettings.json` file (or `Program.cs` if you're using direct connection strings).
3. Modify the connection string to match your local or remote SQL Server instance. Example:

   ```json
   {
     "ConnectionStrings": {
       "DefaultConnection": "Server=YOUR_SERVER_NAME;Database=YOUR_DATABASE_NAME;User Id=YOUR_USERNAME;Password=YOUR_PASSWORD;"
     }
   }

## Running the Project

1. Once the connection string is set up, open the terminal (or use Visual Studio's built-in tools) and navigate to the project directory.
2. Use the following commands to restore the necessary packages and build the project:

   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   dotnet build
   dotnet run
